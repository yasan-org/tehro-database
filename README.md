# Tehro Database

Tehran Metro database used in [Tehro Android app](https://github.com/yasandev/tehro-android).

## Content

Since .db database files are binary and their diff is not visible in commits, all database changes are always also reflected on the SQL & JSON exports of the database file.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. Your changes should be reflected both on the SQL dump and the database file.

For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
