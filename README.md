# Tehro Database
Tehran Metro database used in [Tehro Android app](https://github.com/yasandev/tehro-android).

## Content
Since .db database files are binary and their diff is not visible in commits, all database changes are always also reflected on the SQL & JSON exports of the database file.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. All your changes MUST be reflected on all three variants of the database (db, json & SQL). 

You can use any tool you are familiar with to modify the database but you will have an easier time using [DB Browser for SQLite](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser) as the current database exports are created using it.

For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
