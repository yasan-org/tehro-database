# Tehro Database

Tehran Metro database used in [Tehro Android app](https://github.com/yasandev/tehro-android).

## Content

Since .db database files are binary and their diff is not visible in commits, all database changes are always also reflected on the SQL & JSON exports of the database file.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. Your changes should be reflected both on the [SQL dump](https://github.com/yasandev/tehro-database/blob/main/tehro.sql) and the [database file](https://github.com/yasandev/tehro-database/blob/main/tehro.db).

For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
